Loading Slips as a separate menu option
------------------------------------------

You can now create Loading Slips in a separate form. You enter the 'Valid until' 
date. These Loading Slips can later be used for creating a Transport Order.

There is a new menu choice under Inquiries, Loading Slip Inquiry. If the 
'Valid until' has been passed, the Loading Slip is not shown. But you can 
select 'Show All' and all the Loading Slip inside the period will be shown.

In this Inquiry you have the option to look at the entire Quotation, edit the 
Quotation, print the Quotation and make a Transport Order from the Quotation.

The Loading Slips will not be deleted, so it is possible to use it agan and 
maybe edit it for use again.

The Loading Slips can however be deleted when editing. And when deleting a 
fiscal year, the Quotations will be deleted.

The Transport Order print out can still be selected to be printed as a Quote should 
you prefer that.
